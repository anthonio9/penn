Try dropout and different regularization techniques.

== Divide the dataset (important)

* division for train and validation sets based on the guitar players

== Regularization techniques

* do the parameters to below techniques manually (important)
* weight regularization, weight penalty, comes out of the box with Adam optimizer
* L1, L2 regularization
* ADd noise to inputs, gaussian noise of the same shape 

== Hyperparameters tuning and the three sets (train, test, valid)

== 1st experiment

multi hot piano, one array of 1440 instead of 6.

* use sigmoid istead of softmax
* use binary cross entropy instead of categorical cross entropy

set a threshold for the pitch recognition.

== 2nd experiment

take inspiration from here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435

* use 60 discrete values of MIDI per each string
* use a vector 1-60 for estimating the deviation
